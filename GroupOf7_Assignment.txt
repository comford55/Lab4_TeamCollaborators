The Emperor's New Clothes by Hans Christian Andersen

Many years ago, there was an Emperor, who was so excessively fond of new clothes, that he 
spent all his money in dress. He did not trouble himself in the least about his soldiers; nor did 
he care to go either to the theatre or the chase, except for the opportunities then afforded him 
for displaying his new clothes. He had a different suit for each hour of the day; and as of any 
other king or emperor, one is accustomed to say, "he is sitting in council," it was always said of 
him, "The Emperor is sitting in his wardrobe."
Time passed merrily in the large town which was his capital; strangers arrived every day at the 
court. One day, two rogues, calling themselves weavers, made their appearance. They gave out 
that they knew how to weave stuffs of the most beautiful colors and elaborate patterns, the 
clothes manufactured from which should have the wonderful property of remaining invisible to 
everyone who was unfit for the office he held, or who was extraordinarily simple in character.

So the faithful old minister went into the hall, where the knaves were working with all their 
might, at their empty looms. "What can be the meaning of this?" thought the old man, opening 
his eyes very wide. "I cannot discover the least bit of thread on the looms." However, he did not 
express his thoughts aloud.
The impostors requested him very courteously to be so good as to come nearer their looms; 
and then asked him whether the design pleased him, and whether the colors were not very 
beautiful; at the same time pointing to the empty frames. The poor old minister looked and 
looked, he could not discover anything on the looms, for a very good reason, viz: there was 
nothing there. "What!" thought he again. "Is it possible that I am a simpleton? I have never 
thought so myself; and no one must know it now if I am so. Can it be, that I am unfit for my 
office? No, that must not be said either. I will never confess that I could not see the stuff."


"But the Emperor has nothing at all on!" said a little child.
"Listen to the voice of innocence!" exclaimed his father; and what the child had said was 
whispered from one to another.
"But he has nothing at all on!" at last cried out all the people. The Emperor was vexed, for he 
knew that the people were right; but he thought the procession must go on now! And the lords 
of the bedchamber took greater pains than ever, to appear holding up a train, although, in 
reality, there was no train to hold.
